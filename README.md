# Conveyor-Obejct-Tracking-and-Recognition
This folder contains the script for final project in Perception offered by DTU
# Introduction
Most scripts are developped by Manxi Lin and I used his codes to learn this field.
Based on his thoughts and implementations, I will practice in another similar project in following days.
# This project contains 3 main parts
1. Calibration and Rectification
2. Object Tracking (Including with occlusion and without occlusion)
3. Classification based on Machine Learning or Deep Learning
# All the details have been illustrated in each script and helpful comments have been written by me.
This folder is used to self-learning and review. Thanks for reading.
